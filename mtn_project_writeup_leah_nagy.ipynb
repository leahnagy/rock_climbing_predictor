    "### Abstract\n",
    "The goal of this project was to use Linear Regression models to predict the average user-rating for rock-climbing routes in Kentucky. I collected data from the Mountain Project website about each route using web scraping. After collecting the data, I ran through multiple types of regression models before arriving at a final model.

    "### Design\n",
    "Kentucky has some of the best rock climbing in the world and is considered the rock climbing mecca of the East coast. Rock climbing guides are a vital part of the community there. With over 3,000 routes to choose from, a rock climbing guide company wants to better understand their what makes routes more desirable than others to provide the optimal experience for their clients.

    "\n",
    "##### Model Evaluation and Selection \n",
    "The entire dataset was split into a 60/20/20 - Training/Validation/Testing. I used 5-fold cross validation as I tested various models and scored them based on the validation set. I then combined the training and validation datasets for a final 80/20 (training/testing) split. The testing data was only used on the final model by using the same random state throughout. \n",
    "\n",
    "The metric I used to score my models was Mean Absolute Error (MAE), because it would be in the same unit as my target. Without a need to further penalize outliers, MAE keeps the model more interpretable to stakeholders. While I focused on the MAE, I also worked to reduce multicollinearity, which also increased MAE. In the future I would like to try more interaction terms to improve the model's performance even more."
